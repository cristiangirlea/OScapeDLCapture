# Server Simulation Results

## Summary
This document summarizes the results of our investigation into simulating the server at 192.168.102.55 for testing the CustomDLL and CustomDLLStatic libraries.

## Prerequisites Verification
We have verified that all the necessary components for server simulation are in place:

1. **Scripts**:
   - `scripts\simulate_server.ps1` - Script to set up the simulation environment
   - `scripts\generate_cert.ps1` - Script to generate self-signed certificates

2. **Server**:
   - The Go server (`build\bin\GoServer.exe`) has been built successfully
   - The server is configured to handle requests to `/testoscc.php`

3. **DLL**:
   - The CustomDLLStatic DLL is configured to connect to `https://192.168.102.55/testoscc.php`
   - SSL certificate validation is disabled in the DLL (verifySSL = false)

4. **Test Tools**:
   - `build\bin\test_static_dll.exe` is available for testing the DLL

## Simulation Setup
We have successfully:
1. Generated a self-signed certificate for HTTPS using `scripts\generate_cert.ps1`
2. Created the necessary certificate files in the `certs` directory

## Testing Instructions
To complete the testing, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Simulation Server**:
   - Open a PowerShell window as Administrator
   - Run the following command:
     ```powershell
     .\scripts\simulate_server.ps1 -Port 443 -CertFile ".\certs\test_cert.crt" -KeyFile ".\certs\test_cert.key"
     ```
   - This will:
     - Add an entry to your hosts file to map 192.168.102.55 to 127.0.0.1
     - Start the Go server on port 443 with HTTPS
     - Configure the server to use the generated certificate

2. **Test the DLL**:
   - Open another PowerShell window (does not need to be Administrator)
   - Run the following command:
     ```powershell
     .\build\bin\test_static_dll.exe --verbose
     ```
   - This will:
     - Load the CustomDLLStatic.dll
     - Run test cases that make requests to the simulated server
     - Display the results

3. **Clean Up**:
   - When done testing, press Ctrl+C in the first PowerShell window to stop the server
   - When prompted, choose whether to remove the hosts file entry
   - Alternatively, you can run `.\scripts\simulate_server.ps1 -RemoveHostsEntry` later to clean up

## Expected Results
If the simulation is working correctly, you should see:
1. The server logs showing incoming requests to `/testoscc.php`
2. The test_static_dll.exe reporting successful test cases
3. No SSL certificate validation errors (since verifySSL is set to false in the DLL)

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check that the server is running and listening on the correct port
2. Verify that the hosts file entry was added correctly
3. Ensure that port 443 is not being used by another application
4. Check the server logs for any error messages

## Conclusion
The server simulation environment has been successfully set up. All the necessary components are in place and ready for testing. Following the instructions above should allow you to verify that the DLL can connect to the simulated server and function correctly.
